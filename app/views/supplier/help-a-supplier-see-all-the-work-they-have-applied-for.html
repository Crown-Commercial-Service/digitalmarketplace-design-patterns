  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How the design works</h3>

  <p>When suppliers sign into their accounts, they can view a list of all the contracts they’ve applied for by framework. Only current framework iterations are shown.</p>

  <p>Suppliers can view by:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>applications started</li>
    <li>applications made</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each entry in the list displays the supplier name, deadline and application status, for example won or unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>If the work has been awarded, suppliers can see:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>who won the contract</li>
    <li>the size of the winning company</li>
    <li>how much the contract was worth</li>
    <li>when work started on the contract</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this is useful</h3>

  <p>This design gives suppliers a record of all the work they’ve applied for. It also allows them to see who won the contract if their application was unsuccessful.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to consider</h3>

  <p>It’s worth considering:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>how to refer to work applied for, the Digital Marketplace uses the term ‘opportunities’ but we don’t know how universally understood this is by suppliers and buyers</li>
    <li>how to display the work applied for, at the moment it’s just one long page</li>
    <li>adding an expired status for old framework iterations</li>
    <li>making the link to the work applied for easier to find</li>
  </ul>
