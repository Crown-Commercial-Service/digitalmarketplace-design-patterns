  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How the design works</h3>

  <p>Use this design to help suppliers be clear when they’ve submitted their framework application successfully.</p>

  <p>Currently, to submit an application a supplier has to:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>complete or confirm their company details</li>
    <li>create a supplier declaration</li>
    <li>add details of at least one service</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once these tasks have been completed their application will be submitted on the deadline.</p>

  <p>Suppliers can keeping adding more services right up to the framework application deadline.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this is useful</h3>

  <p>Suppliers need to know that they’ve completed all the necessary steps to apply and have submitted their application on time.</p>


  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to consider</h3>

  <p>This design needs to be thought about in more detail.</p>

  <p>There’s no ‘submit application’ button which has confused suppliers. It makes suppliers question if their application will be submitted. Suppliers regularly raise clarification questions querying this. The only confirmation suppliers receive comes after the application deadline.</p>

  <p>It would also be worth considering:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>emailing suppliers who’ve started an application before the deadline to let them know if their application will be submitted</li>
    <li>making it clearer that if you don’t mark services as complete you haven’t submitted an application</li>
    <li>allowing users to submit an application before the deadline and confirming it’s happened</li>
  </ul>
